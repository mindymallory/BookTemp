# Forecasting: Use Of Corn
## Price Analysis: A Fundamental Approach to the Study of Commodity Prices

---








---

#Highlights

  + In the WASDE balance sheet for corn there are three use categories. 
  
  + Two account for domestic consumption: 
  
   + Food 
   
   + Seed and Industrial
   
   + Feed and Residual  
   
  + Exports make up the third category: 
  
   + Ethanol makes up a large portion of the Food, Seed, and Industrial category, so it is given its own line in the balance sheet. 
   
---

#Highlights (CONT...)

  + Historical use patterns are the first place to starting using the forecast categories for the marketing year. 
  
  + Looking at quarterly gives you a sense of using distribution across the marketing year in different categories. 
  
  + The annual histories, however, are probably the most useful.

## Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use

  + The data was queried from the **Feed Grains database** maintained by the USDA ERS. 
  
  + In Figure 1: the **Food, Alcohol, and Industrial** use category. 
  
---


## Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use (CONT...)

   
  + This omits seed from the **Food, Seed, and Industrial** category in the WASDE balance sheet. 
  
  + The Feed Grains database actually breaks out the seed.  
  
  + Use its own column, but corn used for seed is a very small proportion of production and it is largely predictable from year to year.

--- 


## Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use (CONT...)

  + Figure 1 shows a dramatic uptrend in the Food, Alcohol and Industrial use category. 
  
   + This is due to the dramatic increase in the production of ethanol starting around 2005/2006 and plateauing around 2010. 
  
   + When U.S. ethanol consumption roughly hit the **blend-wall** where ethanol makes up 10% of the retail gasoline supply.

  + Figure 2 shows the same data, but the quarterly figures are aggregated to the marketing year total. 
  
   + In both figures 1 and 2, the rationing effects of high prices that occurred as a result of the drought in 2012. 

---

## Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use (CONT...)

  + From Figure 3, it is easier to see the shares of the crop. 
  
   + The large increase in corn use in the Food, Alcohol, and Industrial use category. 
  
   + In Figure 3 this category is presented as a percentage of that marketing year's production. 
  
   + In the early 1990's, this category accounted for over 50% since 2010. 
  
   + The drop in percentage of production in 2015 occurs because of the large crop in 2015. 
  
   + The use level is flat.

---

## Exports 

  + Quarterly corn exports are displayed in Figure 4. 
  
   + Unlike Food, alcohol and industrial use, exports tend to have a very seasonal or cyclical pattern. 
   
   + Exports are large in the second quarter of the marketing year, december to February, right after we harvest the new crop. 
   
   + The stocks are most plentiful and prices are at season lows in years exhibiting an upward sloped forward curve.

![](assets/ForecastingUseof-ExportsMY.png) 

---

## Exports (CONT...)

  + Displaying the same data in Figure 5, but aggregating to an annual frequency, we see the marketing seasonality smoothed away. 
  
  + On average, it appears that exports follow a constant trend-line with variation around the mean produced by years of surplus or scarcity. 
  
  + The drought year of 2012, is clearly visible as an exceedingly low export year. 

  + In Figure 6, we display annual corn exports as a percentage of corn production. 
  
---

![](assets/ForecastingUseof-CornUseCategoriesExportsPropofUse.png)

---

## Exports (CONT...)

  + When exports are viewed as a proportion of production, we see a pronounced downward trend. 
  
  + This is due to the increasing share of production allocated to the Food, seed, and Industrial category visible in Figure 3. 
  
  + Recall the category is comprised mainly of corn as feed-stock for ethanol production.

  + The year-to-year variation is caused by price fluctuations with low prices encouraging and higher prices discouraging consumption.
  
---

## Exports (CONT...)

  + Table 1 shows the top 12 importers of U.S. corn for the 2016/2017 marketing year. 
  
  + Export totals are given in 1,000 metric ton units. 
  
  + Clearly Japan and Mexico are the dominant Importers of U.S. corn, with South Korea being a distant third. 
  
  + The Table shows that most countries rank has remained fairly stable across the marketing years.

---

## Feed and Residual

  + The final use category is the most difficult to forecast because its quantity is derived, not estimated. 
  
  + The USDA makes estimates of every other row in the balance sheet. 
  
  + To ensure the numbers add up, they infer the Feed and Residual category by subtracting the other demand categories from supply. 

`\(Feed\&amp;Residual = Production + Imports + Beginning Stocks - Ending Stocks\)`
 
`\(- FoodSeed\&amp;Industrial - Exports\)`


---

## Feed and Residual (CONT...)

  + Each category on the right hand side is itself estimated with some error. 
  
  + The error for the Feed and Residual category is the sum of the errors of the other categories. 
  
  + The forecast errors from each of the categories get added together, creating a category with larger forecast error than all the others. 
  
  + For this reason, the Feed and Residual category is the most difficult to forecast. 
  
  + It should correlate roughly to livestock feeding units, but does not prove to be that effective in practice. 
  
---

![](assets/ForecastingUseof-CornUseCategoriesFeedResid.png)



---

## Feed and Residual (CONT...)

 `\(Feed\&amp;Residual = (Production + \epsilon_{prod}) + (Imports + \epsilon_{import})\)`

 `\(+ (Beginning Stocks + \epsilon_{BStocks}) \\ - (Ending Stocks + \epsilon_{EStocks})\)`

 `\(- (FoodSeed\&amp;Industrial + \epsilon_{Food}) - (Exports + \epsilon_{Export})\)`

  + Figure 7 below displays the Feed and Residual category since 1990. 

---

## Feed and Residual (CONT...)

  + Unlike Exports which saw its biggest quarter of use in the second quarter of the marketing year. 
  
  + The biggest quarter of use in the Feed and Residual category is the first (beginning in September). 
  
  + This is because at the end of summer, ranchers bring cattle home from grass and they begin eating grain and hay instead of green grass on pasture. 
  
  + This is also when calves born in the spring begin to be **Fattened** for slaughter. 
  
---

## Feed and Residual (CONT...)

  + Figure 8: shows the Feed and Residual category annually and Figure 9 shows the category annually as a percent of production.
  
  + Figure 8 shows that the category has remained roughly constant over the time-period graphed. 
  
  + As a percentage of production it has fallen since 2005. 
  
  + Like the export category, this reflects a proportional shift in use toward ethanol production.

![](assets/ForecastingUseof-CornUseCategoriesFeedandResidPropofUse.png)

---

## Price Sensitivity of Use Categories 

  + Examining annual figures as a percentage of production reveals some interesting facts about the price sensitivity of the three use categories. 

   + The least price sensitive category seems to be Food, Seed, and Industrial. 
   
   + This should be intuitive because this category is composed primarily of corn for feedstock in ethanol production. 
   
   + Since ethanol consumption is effectively mandated at a certain level by the Renewable Fuels Standard.  
   
   + Users (gasoline blenders) must purchase a certain amount of ethanol to blend into the retail gasoline supply. 
   
   + This implies a significant portion of the corn crop that will be used regardless of the price.
   
---

## Price Sensitivity of Use Categories (CONT...)

  + The second category is Feed and Residual. 
   
   + Although year-to-year variation can come about due to price responsiveness of the U.S. livestock industry. 
   
   + This variation tends to be overwhelmed by the variation due to the aggregate forecast errors in the other categories. 

  + The most price sensitive category is Exports, which is readily visible in Figure 5 and 6. 
  
   + Foreign buyers of corn can substitute to purchase their corn from other parts of the world like (Argentina comes first to mind). 
   
   + The consumers of meat in the less developed world are more price sensitive and presumably reduce consumption when prices are high.
   
---

## Forecasting Use 

  + One method for forecasting is the use of categories during the marketing year, and to keep track of corn consumption whichhas been used to date. 
  
  + This pace of use can be compared to the pace of use in previous years. 
  
  + Alternatively, the pace of use can be expressed as a percent of the WASDE forecast use. 
  
  + Ideally this percent of WASDE forecast would be compared to historical percent of WASDE forecast. 
  
  + The idea behind such exercise being the seasonality in the historical graphs is likely to repeat itself.  
  
  + Information about the pace of use in each category must be obtained from different sources within the USDA. 
  
---

## Food, Seed, and Industrial

  + Ethanol production is the primary user of corn in the Food, Seed, and Industrial Category. 
  
  + This becomes obvious by comparing Figure 10, which displays ethanol production and consumption over time, with Figure 1.
  
  + Ethanol production and consumption begin to increase rapidly around 2005. 
  
  + The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and later the Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007 created the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS). 
  
  + The RFS mandated quantities of ethanol that blenders of gasoline are required to blend into the retail gasoline supply. 
  
---

## Food, Seed, and Industrial (CONT...)

  + These annual mandates are revised every year. 
  
  + They were designed to steadily increase year after year until 2015 when the mandate reached 15 billion gallons per year. 
  
  + This Figure came because gasoline consumption in the United States was forecast to reach 150 billion gallons per year by 2015. 
  
  + The RFS mandates were designed to reach the point where the entire retail gasoline supply would include 10% ethanol. 
  
  + Incidentally, 300,000,000 barrels indicated in Figure 10 corresponds to 15 billion gallons (300,000,000*50gallons/barrel = 15,000,000,000 
  
gallons). 
  
  + The orange line shows that blenders of gasoline have been blending greater than 15 billion gallons of ethanol since 2010. 
  
  
---

![](assets/ForecastingUseof-Ethanol.png)

---

## Food, Seed, and Industrial (CONT...)

  + Without significant growth in the consumption of gasoline in the United States. 
  
  + This corn use category is likely to remain flat for the foreseeable future. 
  
  + Ethanol blenders sometimes experience an ethanol-to-gasoline price ratio that is favorable to blending ethanol even above the levels of the RFS 
mandate. 
  
  + Conducting a pace-of-use analysis for this corn use category makes sense. 
  
  + Data on monthly fuel ethanol production can be found at [EIA.GOV]. 
  
  + Examining the current marketing year's production of ethanol.
  
  + It gives some indication of whether ethanol production is likely to exceed the 15 billion gallon per year mandated level. 

---

## Exports 

  + Two USDA agencies are involved in providing estimates of export sales. 
  
   + The **USDA Foreign Agricultural Service**
  
   + The **USDA Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration** 
   
---

## USDA FAS Export Sales Reporting System

  + The **USDA Foreign Agricultural Service** maintains the Export Sales Reporting System.

  + It reports weekly export quantities and daily reports of large export sales.

  + The Export Sales Reporting Program has its roots from the unexpected purchase of large amounts of grain by the Soviet Union in 1972, **“The** 
  
**Great Russian Grain Robbery”**. 
  
  + The huge, unanticipated purchases of U.S. wheat and corn that year depleted U.S. 
  
  + Reserve stocks which caused a sizable run-up in U.S. food prices.

---

## USDA FAS Export Sales Reporting System (CONT...)

  + There was growing concern that some companies might have an unfair advantage in situations. 
  
  + They had access to market-sensitive information which was unavailable to the public. 
  
  + To ensure that all parties involved in the production and export of U.S. grain had access to up-to-date export information. 
  
  + Congress mandated the Export Sales Reporting program in 1973.

  + Before the program was established, it was difficult for the public to obtain information on exports until the products were actually shipped. 
  
  + The program helps facilitate price stability by guaranteeing that everyone has access to the same information at the same time. 

---

## Daily Reports

  + Under the export sales reporting system, U.S. exporters are required to report all large sales. 
  
  + Report certain designated commodities by 3 p.m. (Eastern time) on the next business day after the sale is made. 
  
  + The designated commodities for these daily reports are wheat (by class), barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, soybeans, soybean cake and meal, 
  
and soybean oil. 

  + Large sales for all reportable commodities except soybean oil are defined as 100,000 metric tons or more of one commodity. 
  
  + In one day, single destination or 200,000 tons or more of one commodity during the weekly reporting period. 
  
  + Large sales for soybean oil are 20,000 tons and 40,000 tons, respectively.

---

## Weekly Reports

  + Weekly reports are also required, regardless of the size of the sales transaction. 
  
  + For all of these commodities: 
  
   + Wheat products 
   
   + Rye 
   
   + Flaxseed 
   
   + Linseed Oil 
   
   + Cotton (by staple length) 
   
---

## Weekly Reports (CONT...)

  + Commodities (Cont...):
   
   + Cottonseed, Cottonseed cake and meal &amp; Cottonseed oil  
   
   + Rice (by class) 
   
   + Cattle hides and skins (cattle, calf, and kip) 
   
   + And, beef. 
   
  + The reporting week for the export sales reporting system is Friday-Thursday. 
  
  + The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to add other commodities to this list. 
  
---

## GIPSA

  + USDA GIPSA mission is **"To facilitate the marketing of:** 
  
   + Livestock 
   
   + Poultry 
   
   + Meat  
   
   + Cereals  
   
   + Oil-seeds and related agricultural products
  
  + Fair and competitive trading practices for the overall benefit of consumers and American agriculture. 
  
---

## History 

  + The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) was established in 1994 as part of the reorganization of the U.S.
  
  + The formation of the agency resulted from the joining of two previously independent agencies: 
  
   + The Federal Grain Inspection Service and the Packers and Stockyards Administration. 
   
  + GIPSA is part of USDA's Marketing and Regulatory Programs, which are working to ensure a productive and competitive global marketplace for U.S. agricultural products.

---

## History (CONT...)

  + The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) was established by Congress in 1976 to manage the national grain inspection system. 
  
  + It was initially established in 1916, and to institute a national grain weighing program. 
  
  + The goal of creating a single Federal grain inspection entity was to ensure development and maintenance of uniform U.S. standards. 
  
  + To develop inspection and weighing procedures for grain in domestic and export trade, and to facilitate grain marketing.

---

## History (CONT...)

  + Today's Packers and Stockyards Program (P&amp;S) is the progeny of the Packers and Stockyards Administration. 
  
  + It was established in 1921 under the Packers and Stockyards Act. 
  
  + The organization was instituted to regulate livestock marketing activities at public stockyards.
  
  + The operations of meat packers and live poultry dealers.
  
---

## History (CONT...)

  + The GIPSA's main objective is to maintain standard in quality grading and weighing. 
  
  + As a by-product of their reporting they also produce on export shipments. 
  
  + Monthly data on grains inspected and weighed for export by (U.S. region) and destination country is available. 
  
  + Annual reports are also available. 

  + FAS &amp; GIPSA have a memorandum of understanding with one another and will be reconciled so the export totals reported by each agency will not  differ substantially. 

---

## Feed and Residual

  + The Residual component tends to dominate the variation in the Feed and Residual category. 
  
  + The USDA does publish statistics related to numbers of cattle, hogs, and poultry. 
  
  + Major changes in livestock numbers produce a detectable impact in the Feed and Residual use category.
  
  + It is worthwhile knowing where to find these estimates. 
  
---

## Feed and Residual (CONT...)


  + The USDA releases a monthly report which gives a sense of trends in beef cattle herd size and production. 
  
  + Similarly, the **Hogs and Pigs** report is released quarterly and provides inventory estimates. 
  
  + The monthly **Poultry Slaughter** report contains the number of head and live weight of:
  
   + Chickens 
   
   + Turkeys  
   
   + Ducks and other poultry slaughtered under Federal inspection.
