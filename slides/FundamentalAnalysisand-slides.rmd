# Balance Sheet Analysis


**Highlights**

  + Balance sheet analysis is the most important tool for fundamentals-based price forecasting.
  
  + This chapter covers the balance sheets take, and introduces the USDA WASDE balance sheet.
  
  + This chapter shows the  affects each row of the balance sheet.
  
  + This chapter provides a timeline of when the rows of a balance sheet can be updated.

# Balance Sheet Analysis (CONT...)

**Check Your Understanding**

+ Do you know which cells in the balance sheet must be estimated by the USDA and which can be calculated from other cells in the table?

  + Fundamental analysis is an assessment of price based on underlying supply and demand factors. 
  
  + Focusing on changes in the relationship between supply and demand allows one to calibrate an informed opinion of the value of the commodity. 
  
  + The main role of the market is to find the value supply equals to demand. 
  
  + The estimated 'fundamental value' is simply a forecast, or expectation of, the market clearing price. 
  
  + The goal of any forecasting exercise is to compare the forecast to the current market price and make decisions accordingly. 
  
---

# Balance Sheet Analysis (CONT...)

**Check Your Understanding**

  + If your forecast is above the current market price, that is bullish because your forecast implies the market is undervaluing the commodity.
  
  + An opportunity to buy low and sell high! 
  
  + If your forecast is below the current market price, that is bearish because your forecast implies the market is overvaluing the commodity. 
  
  + An opportunity to sell high and buy low!

## Supply and Demand

  + Conducting fundamental analyses involves taking into account. 
  
  + All the factors that determine supply, demand, and ultimately, prices. 
  
  + For grain markets there are basically two supply models to keep in mind: 
  
    + Preplanting  
    
    + Post planting. 

  + The intuition here is simply that before planting, the final supply for the crop can be affected by farmers.

## Supply and Demand (CONT...)

**Supply is Affected by:**

+ Acreage

    + Prices of crops competing for acreage

    + Pre-Plant Weather 

+ Yield

    + Post-Plant Weather

+ Government Policies

---
## Supply and Demand (CONT...)

**Supply is Affected by:**

**Acreage** 

  + Before planting, farmers plan how much acreage to devote to each commodity, thus determining the baseline expected production level. 
  
  + Before summer weather is revealed, expected production is simply `Acreage X Trend Yield`. 
  
  + In the Corn Belt, farmer's decision matter where planting the acres between corn and soybeans, their relative prices. 
  
  + If futures prices indicate planting soybeans will be more profitable than planting corn, farmers will plan to devote more acres to soybeans. 
  
---
  
## Supply and Demand (CONT...)

**Supply is Affected by:**

**Acreage**

+ For Example: 
    
  + Weather can be an important determinant of acreage decisions as well. 
    
  + The most ardent planting intentions of a farmer can be derailed by persistent wet weather. 
    
  + An unusually rainy planting season can reduce planted acres from intentions. 
    
  + Before the crop is actually in the ground, the supply of grain is relatively elastic. 
      
---
## Supply and Demand (CONT...)

**Supply is Affected by:**

**Yield**

  + After the crop is planted supply is quite inelastic. 
  
  + There is still considerable uncertainty related to the of the crop will yield. 
  
  + This is largely determined by weather during the growing season.
---

## Supply and Demand (CONT...)

**Supply is Affected by:**

**Government Policies**

  + The government has been heavily involved in Agriculture in the United States since the great depression of the 1930's. 
  
  + There have been programs that guarantee a minimum price, minimum revenue and various incarnations of crop insurance programs. 
  
  + Occasionally these favor the production of one type of crop over another. 
  
  + When this happens, farmers predictably respond by planting more of the crop treated more favorably by the program.   
  
---

## Supply and Demand (CONT...)

**Demand is Affected by:**

**Consumer Income** 

  + When people have more money, they will spend it on goods. 
  
  + This means increased demand for commodities and their derived products. 
  
  + This includes foreign income, since exports are a big component of demand for commodities in the United States. 
  
  + Rising incomes usually means rising consumption of meat, which increases the demand for commodities like corn, soybeans, wheat etc.

  
---

## Supply and Demand (CONT...)

**Demand is Affected by:**

**Exchange Rates**

  + Exchange rates also affect demand through their influence on exports. 
  
  + For Example: 
  
    + If the U.S. dollar is weak, then consumers in other countries can buy dollars cheaply - giving them more purchasing power for goods denominated in dollars. 

---

## Balance Sheet

  + Most fundamental analyses rely on maintaining balance sheets of a commodity for a country, region, or the world. 
  
  + The approach is to maintain a careful accounting of supply exists and quantity of the commodity has been used. 
  
  + Through various means we will explore, one arrives at a price that is expected to ration remaining supplies across competing uses.

### The Marketing Year and Balance Sheet Forecasting Schedule
 
  + Balance sheet analysis is often organized by marketing year. 
  
  + Since production happens once per year, the marketing year is defined in the first month the commodity is harvested aT ends with the following year's harvest:


| Crop                    |  Beginning of Marketing Year - First Month of Harvest |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| Corn                    | September                                            |
| Soybeans                | September                                            |
| Spring Wheat (Chicago)  | August                                               |
| Winter Wheat (KC)       | July                                                 |

### The Marketing Year and Balance Sheet Forecasting Schedule
  + Forecasting supply and demand for any given marketing year begins well before harvest. **Table 2:** Forecasting Calendar for 2017/2018 Marketing Year with Harvest in September 2016:

| Timeline     | Forecasting Focus                                                                                               |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fall 2016    | The first forecasts of supply based on , *trend forecasts*, *recent history*, *economic relationships*    |
| Spring 2017  | Update supply forecasts based on USDA acreage surveys.                                                          |
| Summer 2017  | Update supply forecasts based on weather and USDA crop and stocks reports                                       |
| Fall 2017    | Update supply forecasts as yield uncertainty is resolved through harvest reports and USDA production reports    |
| Summer 2018  | Update supply forecasts based on USDA production revisions, southern hemisphere production, stocks, and use reports.  |



---

### Southern Hemisphere Production

  + Production of corn, soybeans, and other commodities in the southern hemisphere has grown rapidly over the last ten to fifteen years. 
  
  + It has impacted global commodity markets tremendously. 
  
  + Since southern hemisphere production occurs in the middle of marketing years organized by northern hemisphere harvest. 
  
  + There is an uncertain additional supply that must be forecast and updated to keep an accurate global balance sheet.  

---

### Uncertainty 

  + Even careful accounting of supply and demand factors make up the balance sheet leaves a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the market.  
  
  + Demand can be difficult to forecast, and can sometimes change dramatically. 
  
  + The USDA keeps careful track of stocks, but we only get stocks estimates once a quarter. 
  
  + Between *Grain Stocks* reports there is always a great deal of speculation. 
  
  + The pace of consumption we are eating into stocks at a faster or slower pace than expected. 
  
  + Analysts talk about whether the market is on pace to achieve the forecast level of ethanol crush, soybean crush, or exports.

### Balance Sheet Format

The common format balance sheets for any commodity have in common. **Table 3.** Balance Sheet for a General Commodity:

| Stocks and Use   |   | 
|:-------------------|:--|
|Beginning Stocks    |   | 
| + Production       |   |
| + Imports          |   |
| **= Total Supply**     |   |
|Domestic Consumption|    |
| + Exports          |   |
| + Residual          |   |
| **= Total Consumption (Use)**     |   |
| **Ending Stocks = Total Supply - Total Consumption**|    |

### Balance Sheet Format (CONT...)

  + USDA makes regular reports on the balance sheet for commodities. 
  
  + Most of them conducing private analyses with balance sheets use the USDA categories.
  
  + USDA estimates can be taken as a benchmark. 
  
  + The supply side (Stocks) is relatively straightforward. 
  
  + Total stocks for the marketing year will be beginning stocks, the portion of last year's stocks that were not used up during the previous marketing year. 
  
  + Plus this year's production, any imports of the commodity. 
  
  + Summing these three reveals the total amount of the commodity available for use during the marketing year.
  
---

### Balance Sheet Format (CONT...)

**Beginning Stocks:** 

  + Some production from the previous year usually remains into the next crop season. 
  
  + Carryover stocks function as a buffer against current year yield uncertainty. 
  
  + **For example:** 
  
    + If carryover stocks are high and current year yield is expected to be below trend, the market price may fall in response but modestly. 
    
    + If carryover stocks are low - resulting from several years of below trend production and strong demand. 
    
    + An expected yield below trend will likely cause a volatile rise in prices.
    
---

### Balance Sheet Format (CONT...)

  + The balance sheet for corn follows the same generic patter. 
  
  + We can be a bit more specific with the use of the categories. 
  
  + Since we know the major use of the categories are for any given commodity. 
  

---
### Balance Sheet Format (CONT...)

**The use components are as follows:** 

  + Feed and Residual: 
  
    + A large portion of the corn crop is used as feed for livestock (cattle, pigs, poultry).
    
  +  Food, Seed, and Industrial: 
  
    + Corn is used to make tortilla chips, high fructose corn syrup, edible oil and other food items. 
    
    + A portion of the crop is grown specifically as seed for the next years crop. 
    
    + There are some industrial uses for components of processed corn. Those are grouped in this category as well. 
    
  + Ethanol production also demands a significant amount of corn, so much that it gets its own line in the balance sheet. 
  
  + It is technically part of the Food, Seed, and Industrial category.
  
---

### Balance Sheet Format (CONT...)

**The use components are as follows:** 

  + For soybeans, stocks are comprised of beginning stocks, production, and imports. 
  
  + The general balance sheet and the corn balance sheet. 
  
  + The use side, contains items specific to soybeans:

  + **Crush:**
  
    + The amount of raw soybeans that are processed into soybean oil and soybean meal. 
    
    + Soybean oil is used predominately as edible oil; it also is used to make bio-diesel in modest quantities.

---
### Balance Sheet Format (CONT...)

**The use components are as follows:** 


  + **Crush** 
  
    + Soybeans used domestically almost exclusively get crushed into soybean oil and soybean meal 
    
  + **Exports:** 
  
    + The United States exports a large quantity of soybeans to global buyers.
    
  +  The final use category is export. 
  
  + Soybeans grown in the United States is consumed around the globe, and strength or weakness in the export market is a carefully component of demand.

## Coming up with a Price

  + Balance sheet forecasting is definitely as much art as it is science. 
  
  + It involves tracking of the rate and use of commodities. 
  
  + One should intuitively see the forecasted ending stocks is a measure of scarcity of the commodity. 
  
  + It should be negatively related to price (i.e., tight ending stocks go along with high prices). 
  
  + One needs to pin down the exact nature of this relationship in order to form a meaningful forecast of price from a commodity balance sheet. 
  
---

## Exercises

1. Copy and paste the corn and soybeans balance sheets into a spreadsheet. 

    + In the cell next to **= Total Supply**, manually add the cells needed to reproduce the **'=Total Supply'** number.
    
    + in the cell next to **= Total Consumption**, manually add the cells needed to reproduce the **= Total Consumption** number. 
    
2. If you were making a forecast in July 2015 for the 2014/2015 marketing year balance sheet, which columns (if any) should remain fixed? I.e., they are already determined and do not need to be forecast. 

3. If you were making a forecast in July 2015 for the 2015/2016 marketing year balance sheet, which columns (if any) should remain fixed?
