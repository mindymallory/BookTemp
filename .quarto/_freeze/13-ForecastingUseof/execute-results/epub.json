Please let me know by</span> [taking the survey](https://forms.gle/Q3VByCQZHjfQSy9D7)! \n\n\nIn the WASDE balance sheet for corn there are three use categories. Two\naccount for domestic consumption - Food, Seed and Industrial, and Feed\nand Residual - while exports make up the third category. Ethanol makes\nup a large portion of the Food, Seed, and Industrial category, so it is\ngiven its own line in the balance sheet.\n\nAs we have noted before, historical use patterns are the first place to\nstart when trying to forecast use categories for the marketing year.\nLooking at quarterly gives you a sense of how use is distributed across\nthe marketing year in different categories. The annual histories,\nhowever, are probably the most useful.\n\n![](assets/ForecastingUseof-CornUseCategories.png)\n\n## Food, Alcohol, and Industrial Use\n\nLet us begin by looking at the Food, Alcohol and Industrial category.\nThese data were queried from the [Feed Grains\ndatabase](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780)\nmaintained by the USDA ERS. The categories here are a little more\ndisaggregated than those presented in the USDA WASDE balance sheets, but\nthey are roughly the same. For example, in figure 1 below we show the\n*Food, Alcohol, and Industrial* use category. This omits seed from the\n*Food, Seed, and Industrial* category in the WASDE balance sheet. The\nFeed Grains database actually breaks out the seed use as its own column,\nbut corn used for seed is a very small proportion of production and it\nis largely predictable from year to year.\n\n![](assets/ForecastingUseof-CornUseCategoriesFoodAlcoholInd.png) Source:\n[Feed Grains\ndatabase](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780)\nmaintained by the USDA ERS.\n\nFigure 1 shows a dramatic uptrend in the Food, Alcohol and Industrial\nuse category. This is due to the dramatic increase in the production of\nethanol starting around 2005/2006 and plateauing around 2010 when U.S.\nethanol consumption roughly hit the 'blend-wall' where ethanol makes up\n10% of the retail gasoline supply.\n\n![](assets/ForecastingUseof-CornUseCategoriesFoodAlcoholIndMY.png)\nSource: [Feed Grains\ndatabase](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780)\nmaintained by the USDA ERS.\n\nFigure 2 shows the same data, but the quarterly figures are aggregated\nto the marketing year total. In both figures 1 and 2 the rationing\neffects of high prices that occurred as a result of the drought in 2012.\n\n![](assets/ForecastingUseof-CornUseCategoriesFoodAlcoholIndPropofUse.png)\nSource: [Feed Grains\ndatabase](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780)\nmaintained by the USDA ERS.\n\nFrom figure 3 it is easier to see what share of the crop the large\nincrease in corn use in the Food, Alcohol, and Industrial use category.\nIn figure 3 this use category is presented as a percentage of that\nmarketing year's production. In the early 1990's this use category\naccounted for over 50% since 2010. The drop in percentage of production\nin 2015 occurs because of the large crop in 2015, even though the use\nlevel is flat (shown in figure 2).\n\n## Exports\n\nQuarterly corn exports are displayed in figure 4. Unlike Food, alcohol\nand industrial use, exports tend to have a very seasonal or cyclical\npattern. Exports are large in the second quarter of the marketing year,\nDecember to February, right after we harvest the new crop. This is when\nstocks are most plentiful and prices are at season lows in years\nexhibiting an upward sloped forward curve.\n\n![](assets/ForecastingUseof-CornUseCategoriesExports.png)\n\nSource: [Feed Grains\ndatabase](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780)\nmaintained by the USDA ERS.\n\nDisplaying the same data in Figure 5, but aggregating to an annual\nfrequency, we see the marketing seasonality smoothed away.\n\n![](assets/ForecastingUseof-ExportsMY.png)\n\nSource: [Feed Grains\ndatabase](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780)\nmaintained by the USDA ERS.\n\nOn average, it appears that exports follow a constant trend-line with\nvariation around the mean produced by years of surplus or scarcity. The\ndrought year 2012, for example is clearly visible as an exceedingly low\nexport year.\n\nIn figure 6 we display annual corn exports as a percentage of corn\nproduction.\n\n![](assets/ForecastingUseof-CornUseCategoriesExportsPropofUse.png)\nSource: [Feed Grains\ndatabase](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780)\nmaintained by the USDA ERS.\n\nWhen exports are viewed as a proportion of production, we see a\npronounced downward trend. This is due to the increasing share of\nproduction allocated to the Food, seed, and Industrial category visible\nin figure 3. Recall that this category is comprised mainly of corn as\nfeed-stock for ethanol production.\n\nThe year-to-year variation is caused by price fluctuations with low\nprices encouraging and high prices discouraging consumption. The\nmarketing year 2020 has shown a dramatic uptick in expected exports both\nin millions of bushels and as a proportion of total use. A dramatic\nincrease in buying from China relative to previou levels has been the\nbiggest contributor.\n\n: Table 1: Top 12 Importers of U.S. Corn 2012/2013 through 2016/2017\nMarketing Years, Ranked in Descending Order for Marketing Year 2015/2016\n(1,000 Metric Tons)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|COUNTRY |EXPORTS 2016/2017 |RANK |EXPORTS 2015/2016 |RANK |EXPORTS 2014/2015 |RANK |EXPORTS 2013/2014 |RANK |\n|:-------|:-----------------|:----|:-----------------|:----|:-----------------|:----|:-----------------|:----|\n|MEXICO  |13539.7           |1    |12558.6           |1    |10793.8           |2    |10526.3           |2    |\n|JAPAN   |11983.4           |2    |10506.6           |2    |11858.6           |1    |11487.0           |1    |\n|KOR REP |5588.5            |3    |3021.6            |4    |3927.2            |4    |4844.2            |3    |\n|COLOMB  |4438.9            |4    |4629.5            |3    |4413.3            |3    |3359.4            |4    |\n|PERU    |3166.7            |5    |2490.9            |5    |2421.0            |5    |1414.5            |8    |\n|TAIWAN  |2773.2            |6    |2045.2            |6    |1755.0            |6    |1936.4            |7    |\n|S ARAB  |2240.4            |7    |1516.4            |7    |1312.7            |8    |1021.0            |9    |\n|GUATMAL |1008.9            |8    |897.1             |10   |936.7             |9    |783.9             |11   |\n|MOROCCO |905.3             |9    |438.4             |15   |310.9             |18   |201.2             |22   |\n|C RICA  |840.2             |10   |520.1             |13   |784.1             |11   |593.6             |13   |\n|DOM REP |814.9             |11   |252.1             |22   |599.3             |13   |637.6             |12   |\n|CHINA   |717.9             |12   |184.8             |24   |473.5             |15   |2759.4            |5    |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSource: [USDA FAS](http://apps.fas.usda.gov/export-sales/myrk_rpt.htm)\n\nTable 1 shows the top 12 importers of U.S. corn for the 2016/2017\nmarketing year. Export totals are given in 1,000 metric ton units.\nClearly Japan and Mexico are the dominant Importers of U.S. corn, with\nSouth Korea being a distant third. The table shows that most countries\nrank has remained fairly stable across the marketing years shown.\n\n## Feed and Residual\n\nThe final use category is the most difficult to forecast because its\nquantity is derived, not estimated. This means the USDA makes estimates\nof every other row in the balance sheet. Then, to ensure the numbers add\nup, they infer the Feed and Residual category by subtracting the other\ndemand categories from supply.\n\n$Feed\\&Residual = Production + Imports + Beginning Stocks - Ending Stocks - FoodSeed\\&Industrial - Exports$\n\nSince each category on the right hand side is itself estimated with some\nerror, the error for the Feed and Residual category is the sum of the\nerrors of the other categories. This means that forecast errors from\neach of the categories get added together, creating a category with\nlarger forecast error than all the others. For this reason the Feed and\nResidual category is the most difficult to forecast. It should correlate\nroughly to livestock feeding units, but does not prove to be that\neffective in practice.\n\n$\\begin{align} Feed\\&Residual = (Production + \\epsilon_{prod}) + (Imports + \\epsilon_{import}) + (Beginning Stocks + \\epsilon_{BStocks}) \\\\ - (Ending Stocks + \\epsilon_{EStocks}) - (FoodSeed\\&Industrial + \\epsilon_{Food}) - (Exports + \\epsilon_{Export}) \\end{align}$\n\nFigure 7 below displays the Feed and Residual category since 1990.\n\n![](assets/ForecastingUseof-CornUseCategoriesFeedResid.png)\n\nSource: [Feed Grains\ndatabase](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780)\nmaintained by the USDA ERS.\n\nUnlike Exports which saw its biggest quarter of use in the second\nquarter of the marketing year (beginning in December), the biggest\nquarter of use in the Feed and Residual category is the first (beginning\nin September). This is because at the end of summer ranchers 'bring\ncattle home from grass' and they begin eating grain and hay instead of\ngreen grass on pasture. This is also when calves born in the spring\nbegin to be 'fattened' for slaughter.\n\nFigure 8: shows the Feed and Residual category annually and figure 9\nshows the category annually as a percent of production.\n\n![](assets/ForecastingUseof-FeedandResidualMY.png)\n\nSource: [Feed Grains\ndatabase](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780)\nmaintained by the USDA ERS.\n\n![](assets/ForecastingUseof-CornUseCategoriesFeedandResidPropofUse.png)\n\nSource: [Feed Grains\ndatabase](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx#26780)\nmaintained by the USDA ERS.\n\nFigure 8 shows that the category has remained roughly constant over the\ntime-period graphed, but as a percentage of production it has fallen\nsince 2005. Like the export category, this reflects a proportional shift\nin use toward ethanol production.\n\n## Price Sensitivity of Use Categories\n\nExamining annual figures as a percentage of production reveals some\ninteresting facts about the price sensitivity of the three use\ncategories.\n\nThe least price sensitive category seems to be Food, Seed, and\nIndustrial. This should be intuitive because this category is composed\nprimarily of corn for feedstock in ethanol production. Since ethanol\nconsumption is effectively mandated at a certain level by the Renewable\nFuels Standard, users (gasoline blenders) must purchase a certain amount\nof ethanol to blend into the retail gasoline supply. This implies a\nsignificant portion of the corn crop that will be used regardless of the\nprice.\n\nThe second category is Feed and Residual. Although year-to-year\nvariation can come about due to price responsiveness of the U.S.\nlivestock industry, this variation tends to be overwhelmed by the\nvariation due to the aggregate forecast errors in the other categories.\n\nThe most price sensitive category is Exports, which is readily visible\nin figure 5 and 6. Foreign buyers of corn can substitute to purchase\ntheir corn from other parts of the world like (Argentina comes first to\nmind). Also, consumers of meat (exported corn is primarily used as\nanimal feed in the foreign country) in the less developed world are more\nprice sensitive and presumably reduce consumption when prices are high.\n\n## Forecasting Use\n\nOne method for forecasting the use categories during the marketing year,\nis to keep track of how much corn has been used to date in each\ncategory. This pace of use can be compared to the pace of use in\nprevious years. Alternatively, the pace of use can be expressed as a\npercent of the WASDE forecast use. Ideally this percent of WASDE\nforecast use would be compared to historical percent of WASDE forecast\nuse. The idea behind such an exercise being the seasonality we saw in\nthe historical graphs above is likely to repeat itself. Information\nabout the pace of use in each category must be obtained from different\nsources within the USDA.\n\n### Food, Seed, and Industrial\n\nWe discussed above that ethanol production is the primary user of corn\nin the Food, Seed, and Industrial Category. This becomes obvious by\ncomparing figure 10 below, which displays ethanol production and\nconsumption over time, with figure 1 above.\n\n![](assets/ForecastingUseof-Ethanol.png)\n\nSource: [EIA](http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/#renewable)\nwebsite. Click the link for access to the raw data.\n\nEthanol production and consumption begin to increase rapidly around\n2005, which is when the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and later the Energy\nSecurity and Independence Act of 2007 created the Renewable Fuels\nStandard (RFS). The RFS mandated quantities of ethanol that blenders of\ngasoline are required to blend into the retail gasoline supply. These\nannual mandates are revised every year, but they were designed to\nsteadily increase year after year until 2015 when the mandate reached 15\nbillion gallons per year. This figure came about because gasoline\nconsumption in the United States was forecast to reach 150 billion\ngallons per year by 2015. So the RFS mandates were designed to reach the\npoint where the entire retail gasoline supply would include 10% ethanol.\nIncidentally, 300,000,000 barrels indicated in Figure 10 corresponds to\n15 billion gallons (300,000,000\\*50gallons/barrel = 15,000,000,000\ngallons). The orange line shows that blenders of gasoline have been\nblending greater than 15 billion gallons of ethanol since 2010.\n\nGoing forward, without significant growth in the consumption of gasoline\nin the United States, this corn use category is likely to remain flat\nfor the foreseeable future. Even so, ethanol blenders sometimes\nexperience an ethanol-to-gasoline price ratio that is favorable to\nblending ethanol even above the levels of the RFS mandate. So conducting\na pace-of-use analysis for this corn use category makes sense as well.\nData on monthly fuel ethanol production can be found at\n[EIA.GOV](http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/#renewable).\nExamining the current marketing year's production of ethanol gives some\nindication of whether ethanol production is likely to exceed the 15\nbillion gallon per year mandated level.\n\n### Exports\n\nTwo USDA agencies are involved in providing estimates of export sales.\nThe [USDA Foreign Agricultural Service](http://www.fas.usda.gov/) and\nthe [USDA Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards\nAdministration](http://www.gipsa.usda.gov/).\n\n#### USDA FAS Export Sales Reporting System\n\nThe [USDA Foreign Agricultural Service](http://www.fas.usda.gov/)\nmaintains the Export Sales Reporting System, which reports weekly export\nquantities and daily reports of large export sales. From the FAS\n[website](https://apps.fas.usda.gov/export-sales/FACT%20SHEET.pdf):\n\n<!--downloaded pdf incase usda takes the fact sheet down. -->\n\n> The Export Sales Reporting Program has its roots from the unexpected\n> purchase of large amounts of grain by the Soviet Union in 1972, \"The\n> Great Russian Grain Robbery\". The huge, unanticipated purchases of\n> U.S. wheat and corn that year depleted U.S. reserve stocks which\n> caused a sizable run-up in U.S. food prices.\n>\n> Furthermore, there was growing concern that some companies might have\n> an unfair advantage in situations like this because they had access to\n> market-sensitive information that was unavailable to the public. To\n> ensure that all parties involved in the production and export of U.S.\n> grain had access to up-to-date export information, Congress mandated\n> the Export Sales Reporting program in 1973.\n>\n> Before the program was established, it was difficult for the public to\n> obtain information on exports until the products were actually\n> shipped. The program helps facilitate price stability by guaranteeing\n> that everyone has access to the same information at the same time.\n\n### Daily Reports\n\nUnder the export sales reporting system, U.S. exporters are required to\nreport all large sales of certain designated commodities by 3 p.m.\n(Eastern time) on the next business day after the sale is made. The\ndesignated commodities for these daily reports are wheat (by class),\nbarley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, soybeans, soybean cake and meal, and\nsoybean oil. Large sales for all reportable commodities except soybean\noil are defined as 100,000 metric tons or more of one commodity in one\nday to a single destination or 200,000 tons or more of one commodity\nduring the weekly reporting period. Large sales for soybean oil are\n20,000 tons and 40,000 tons, respectively. \\> \\#\\#\\# Weekly Reports\nWeekly reports are also required, regardless of the size of the sales\ntransaction, for all of these commodities, as well as wheat products,\nrye, flaxseed, linseed oil, cotton (by staple length), cottonseed,\ncottonseed cake and meal, cottonseed oil, rice (by class), and cattle\nhides and skins (cattle, calf, and kip), and beef. The reporting week\nfor the export sales reporting system is Friday-Thursday. The Secretary\nof Agriculture has the authority to add other commodities to this list.\nSource: [USDA\nFAS](http://apps.fas.usda.gov/export-sales/backgrnd.htm#Daily%20Reports)\n\n#### GIPSA\n\nUSDA GIPSA mission is \"To facilitate the marketing of livestock,\npoultry, meat, cereals, oil-seeds, and related agricultural products,\nand promote fair and competitive trading practices for the overall\nbenefit of consumers and American agriculture.\" From the GIPSA website:\n\n> ### History\n>\n> The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA)\n> was established in 1994 as part of the reorganization of the U.S.\n> Department of Agriculture. The formation of the agency resulted from\n> the joining of two previously independent agencies: the Federal Grain\n> Inspection Service and the Packers and Stockyards Administration.\n> Today, GIPSA is part of USDA's Marketing and Regulatory Programs,\n> which are working to ensure a productive and competitive global\n> marketplace for U.S. agricultural products.\n>\n> The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) was established by\n> Congress in 1976 to manage the national grain inspection system, which\n> initially was established in 1916, and to institute a national grain\n> weighing program. The goal of creating a single Federal grain\n> inspection entity was to ensure development and maintenance of uniform\n> U.S. standards, to develop inspection and weighing procedures for\n> grain in domestic and export trade, and to facilitate grain marketing.\n>\n> Today's Packers and Stockyards Program (P&S) is the progeny of the\n> Packers and Stockyards Administration, which was established in 1921\n> under the Packers and Stockyards Act. The organization was instituted\n> to regulate livestock marketing activities at public stockyards and\n> the operations of meat packers and live poultry dealers. Source: [USDA\n> GIPSA](http://www.gipsa.usda.gov/about/mission.aspx)\n\nThe GIPSA's main objective is to maintain standard in quality grading\nand weighing, but as a by-product of their reporting they also produce\n[useful statistics](http://www.gipsa.usda.gov/fgis/public_reports.aspx)\non export shipments. Monthly data on grains inspected and weighed for\nexport by (U.S. region) and destination country is available. Annual\nreports are also available.\n\nSince the FAS and the GIPSA come about their export totals through\ndifferent processes, they will occasionally differ in their summary\nestimates. They have a memorandum of understanding with one another that\ndifferences will be reconciled so that the export totals reported by\neach agency will not differ substantially.\n\n### Feed and Residual\n\nWhile the Residual component tends to dominate the variation in the Feed\nand Residual category, the USDA does publish statistics related to\nnumbers of cattle, hogs, and poultry. Major changes in livestock numbers\nproduce a detectable impact in the Feed and Residual use category, to it\nis worthwhile knowing where to find these estimates.\n\nThe USDA releases a monthly [Cattle on\nFeed](http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1020)\nreport. Tracking this report gives a sense of trends in beef cattle herd\nsize and production. Similarly, the [Hogs and\nPigs](http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1086)\nreport is released quarterly and provides inventory estimates. The\nmonthly [Poultry\nSlaughter](https://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1131)\nreport contains the number of head and live weight of chickens, turkeys,\nducks and other poultry slaughtered under Federal inspection.\n\n## Readings\n\n[Reviewing the Pace of Corn and Soybean\nExports](http://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2015/01/reviewing-pace-of-corn-and-soybean-exports.html)\n\nNewton, J. \"Reviewing the Pace of Corn and Soybean Exports.\" farmdoc\ndaily (5):14, Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics,\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, January 26, 2015.\n",
